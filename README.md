# CC-HARDBET
There are 3 problems in a contest namely A,B,C respectively. Alice bets Bob that problem C is the hardest while Bob says that problem B will be the hardest.

You are given three integers SA,SB,SC which denotes the number of successful submissions of the problems A,B,C respectively. It is guaranteed that each problem has a different number of submissions. Determine who wins the bet.

1) If Alice wins the bet (i.e. problem C is the hardest), then output Alice.

2) If Bob wins the bet (i.e. problem B is the hardest), then output Bob.

3) If no one wins the bet (i.e. problem A is the hardest), then output Draw.

Note: The hardest problem is the problem with the least number of successful submissions.
